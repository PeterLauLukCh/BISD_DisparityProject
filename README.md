# Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Poisson Binomial Distribution to Normal Distribution: A Fast Algorithm to Estimate Confidence Interval of BISD Result

The project is primarily based on the result from Dr. Philip Greengard and Dr. Andrew Gelman's research *BISG: When inferring race or ethnicity, does it matter that people often live near their relatives?* (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09126.pdf). 

The objective of this project is to calculate disparity using the results from Bayesian Geocoding (BISD). Through BISD, given the surname and geological information of a specific person, we can determine the probability that this person belongs to a specific race.
